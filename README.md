Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally. We use NPM to manage the dependencies, so we strongly recommend you to use it. You can run npm install to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).

Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
